## 🛠 Featured Engineering

### 1. Holographic Avatar System
A sophisticated, interactive hero component that blends mathematics with visual design.
- **Physics-Based Interaction**: 3D tilt geometry reacting to real-time cursor coordinates.
- **Inertia Engine**: Smooth motion stabilization using linear interpolation (Lerp).
- **Magnetic Glow**: Dynamic radial gradients that interpolate position and opacity for depth.
- **Orbital Particles**: A lightweight Canvas2D particle system with adaptive density for mobile performance.

### 2. High-End UI Architecture
- **Zero-Flicker Theme Engine**: Inline detection script ensuring a seamless dark/light mode transition without Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC).
- **Intersection Observer Reveal**: Optimized scroll animations that trigger as elements enter the viewport.
- **Performance Capping**: Particle systems and animations are capped at 60 FPS and pause when the tab is inactive to preserve system resources.
