# Mustafa Shah - Personal Developer Portfolio

A high-end, responsive, and performance-optimized personal portfolio for a Medical Laboratory Technician and Web Developer. Built with **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Live Features

### 1. Holographic Avatar System
- **3D Tilt Effect**: Profile image reacts to cursor position with smooth physics-based easing.
- **Magnetic Glow**: A radial light follows the cursor within the avatar bounds, interpolating position and opacity for a premium feel.
- **Orbital Particles**: Canvas-based orbital system with adaptive particle count for mobile devices.
- **Inertia Engine**: All motion uses lerp (`current += (target - current) * 0.08`) for smooth stabilization.
- **Breathing Effect**: Subtle idle scaling animation to make the interface feel alive.

### 2. Interactive UI/UX
- **Particle Background**: Optimized canvas background with FPS capping and tab-visibility pausing.
- **Zero-Flicker Dark Mode**: Inline theme detection script to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC).
- **Scroll Reveal**: Elements fade and slide in as they enter the viewport using the Intersection Observer API.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive across all devices and screen sizes.

### 3. Professional Sections
- **Hero**: Dynamic typing animation for professional titles.
- **About Me**: Concise intro highlighting the intersection of Healthcare and Technology.
- **Skills**: Categorized cards (Programming, Web, Tools, Other) without distracting progress bars.
- **Projects**: Credibility-focused cards with **Problem**, **Solution**, and **Outcome** metadata.
- **Learning Journey**: Vertical timeline with punchy milestones.
- **Contact**: Direct action links for Email, GitHub, Fiverr, and WhatsApp.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

## ⚡ Performance Optimization
- **FPS Capping**: Custom particle systems are capped at 30-60 FPS to save CPU energy.
- **Resource Management**: Animations pause when the tab is inactive.
- **Bundle Size**: Zero external JS libraries; extremely small resource footprint.
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query by disabling intense animations.
